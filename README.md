## Troubleshooting

When working with Salesforce and this project in particular, you might encounter some common issues. Here are troubleshooting steps for some of these scenarios:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Common Deployment Issues

- üö´ **Problem:** Deployment to Salesforce fails with various error messages.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Solution:** Ensure that your Salesforce CLI is up to date and that you have the correct permissions in your target org. Check the error message details for clues on what might be wrong with your source code or metadata.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Apex Test Failures

- üö´ **Problem:** Apex tests failing upon deployment.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Solution:** Before deploying, run your Apex tests locally using the Salesforce CLI command `sfdx force:apex:test:run`. This helps identify any failing tests early. Ensure all tests pass and provide sufficient code coverage.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualforce Page Errors

- üö´ **Problem:** Visualforce pages not rendering as expected.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Solution:** Check your page's controller for any errors. Ensure that any custom components or JavaScript resources are correctly referenced and loaded. Use your browser's developer tools to troubleshoot JavaScript or resource loading issues.
